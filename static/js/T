You are a Senior Product Architect + Blockchain Engineer + Full-Stack Developer.

🧠 Platform Concept (Core Idea)

Build a clipping website where:

Businesses/creators (Campaign Owners) create campaigns

Users (Clippers) join campaigns, submit clips, and get paid

All payments happen in crypto

Funds are locked upfront in a custodial wallet per campaign to prevent scams



---

👥 User Roles

1. Admin (Platform Owner)


2. Campaign Owner (Business / Creator)


3. User / Clipper




---

🏗️ Campaign Creation Flow

When a Campaign Owner creates a campaign, they must:

Define:

Campaign title & description

Platform type (YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, TikTok, etc.)

Clip requirements (length, format, rules)

Payment per clip

Maximum number of clips

Campaign deadline


Deposit full campaign budget upfront

Budget = (payment per clip × max clips) + platform fee


Funds go into a campaign-specific custodial wallet

Campaign becomes active only after funds are deposited


⚠️ Campaign owners cannot withdraw funds once the campaign is live unless:

Campaign expires

Remaining unused funds are refundable



---

💼 Wallet & Crypto Requirements

Supported wallets: MetaMask, WalletConnect, Phantom (if Solana), etc.

Users must connect their wallet before joining any campaign

Each campaign has:

A custodial smart contract wallet

Locked funds until payout conditions are met


Platform earns a fixed or percentage fee



---

🎬 User (Clipper) Flow

1. User connects crypto wallet


2. User browses live campaigns


3. User joins a campaign


4. User submits:

Clip file or link

Proof of upload (URL)



5. User requests payment


6. Payment status:

Pending

Approved

Rejected

💸 Payment Approval Logic (Anti-Scam System)

Option 1: Campaign Owner Approval

Owner reviews clip

Accepts → smart contract auto-pays user

Rejects → must provide reason


Option 2: Admin Escalation (Fail-Safe)

If owner:

Ignores requests

Tries to scam


Admin reviews:

Clip validity

Campaign rules


Admin can force-approve payout

Payment auto-sent from custodial wallet


🚫 Owners cannot block payments unfairly


---

Funds locked at campaign creation

Auto-payment on approval

Admin override permission

Transparent on-chain records

Emergency pause mechanism
